<a name="Introduction"><H3>Introduction</H3></a>
Well, this is one of many websites of mine.  I have a hard time of picking something to write about, so I often find myself drifting around from subject to subject.<BR>
Anyways, I hope you enjoy the site, and if you don't, well (some people would say tuff, but I say...) then email me and tell me what you want to see :).<BR>
<a name="WebServices"><H3>Services</H3></a>
As a free service, I'm willing to help people develop a home page.  I can suggest places to get a free
web page and help with the HTML (coding) and other webmaster related stuff.<BR>
I will also review your website, if you would like me to.  As stated above, all of these services are free.<BR>
You can contact me at <a href="mailto:jamesrskemp@yahoo.com?subject=Web Design">jamesrskemp@yahoo.com</a><BR>
<a name="Thoughts"><H3>Thoughts</H3></a>
aka: Crazy Ramblings :)<BR>
I'll make a little page for my thoughts, but until then, I'm just going to post them here.<BR>
Pretty much what I'm going to do, is start with one particular thought or topic, and just keep typing.  The purpose of this is to get my mind rolling things over and over in my head.  Perhaps, after I reread some of this, I'll discover some new thought or idea.  If nothing else, it will get me writing about something :).<BR>
<U><B>January 21st, 2001</B></U>: Dreams and reality (turning into random rambling)<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">S</font>ometimes, I ask myself the old question: 'Are we awake when we dream, and dream when we are awake?'<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">W</font>hat do I mean?  Well, quite a lot (I think).  They say that there is only one universal constant, one thing we can be sure of: Death.  I suppose, if you wanted to be technical, you could say life.  However, we don't know if life will ever really take place again, we know that we were born (or so we believe), but nobody has to be born ever again.  The sun <u>could</u> go nova tomorrow, or in five seconds, or right after you say <I>a boy will be born in two seconds</I>.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">S</font>o, the one universal constant is death.  Nothing else has to occur, but death does.  Now, I'm sure it seems as though I'm just rambling on about stuff that is completely unrelated to my original topic, but bare with me.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">N</font>ow, how does what I just said (universal constant = death) have to do with dreams?  Well, it shows that we really don't know anything <u>has to be</u> true (except death).  We think gravity pulls us towards the earth, but what if gravity pushes us away instead?<BR>
 <I><font color="2bc43a">H</font>uh?</I><BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">T</font>hat's right, what if the solar system, or space, or whatever, the stuff outside earth, has a gravity that is greater then earth?  That causes things to push towards the earth.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">S</font>till don't get it?  That's okay, I don't understand that explanation either.  Okay, how about this: What I'm trying to say, is, what if gravity, instead of pulling things towards the object, pushed them away from the object.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">T</font>he earth has gravity, and instead of pulling us closer, it's pushing us away.  However, another 'object' in outer space, has a <u>greater</U> gravity.  That object is pushing things away from it as well.  It's like two people pushing a block on either side of it.  The greater force, or more powerful person, will push the block towards the lesser.  Earth's gravity pushes us away from the planet, but a greater force pushes us right back.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">O</font>f course, it really doesn't matter.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">N</font>ow, back to dreams :).  My hypothesis is: We are figments of our own imaginations.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">N</font>ow, I obviously have to back that up.  Now, I could just say, <I>Disprove it</I>.  However, I don't see anyway for someone to do that (but by all means, I would enjoy to hear your ideas).  I suppose I could say <I>We don't really know anything about how our brains/minds work. For all we know, there is nothing around us.</I>  We touch the 'table' in front of us, and since our eyes see something there, our brain goes, "oh, I should feel something when I put my fingers/hands there".  Our brain sends a message "hard, smooth", whatever, to our fingers, and we feel it.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">J</font>ust think of a virtual reality machine.  Supposedly, it's like you are there.  Or how about hypnosis.  People can believe suggestions placed by another person.  Whether you believe in it or not is up to you.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">A</font>nother question I have, is, whether other people are real or not.  Now, if they aren't real, they are from our imagination, and therefore it's possible we are from our imagination as well.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">W</font>hy do I question whether or not people are real?  Because they are irrational at times.  Sometimes people do things that we just have to wonder what was going through their heads!  Now tell me, when you have a dream, are things always rational?<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">I</font> know mine aren't.  First I'll be talking to my sister, then she'll turn into a co-worker, then she's a man!  :)  I'll be discussing work, then I'll be talking about the weather.  Just take a look at a conversion after you've had it.  Try to stay away from work conversations, usually those are pretty one track.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">I</font> often will look back at a conversation, and wonder how I went from <I>Are you feeling better?</I> to <I>Krista dropped a <U>whole</U> container of cherries on the ground, and didn't clean it up!</I>.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">H</font>ave you ever said something that was completely off topic?  I know I have.  It just pops into your head.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">H</font>ave you ever lost your train of thought?  Yup, I know I have.<BR>
 <I><font color="2bc43a">Y</font>ou're getting boring James.</I>  Okay, so I am.  What am I trying to say?  That 'life', just like our dreams, are completely messed up sometimes.  I've had dreams that make more sense then
some days :).<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">S</font>ometimes you'll hear <I>He's lost touch with reality</I>.  Often you'll here it said about people who have gone crazy, or no longer communicate with people.  If someone doesn't conform to our ideals, we push him away.  When I say 'our', read that as 'our own personal'.<BR>
 <font color="2bc43a">T</font>here's a great quote out there dealing with <I>When each person
sees the world for the first time, it's a completely new world.</I> or something like that.  Meaning of course, that we each have our own views on things.  What I see as right, you might see as wrong and vice versa.  Until proven otherwise, we each think we are right.  <I>There's two sides to every story</I>.  How true.<BR>
